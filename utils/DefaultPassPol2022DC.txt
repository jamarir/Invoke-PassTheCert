lockoutobservationwindow                 : -18000000000
Reset account lockout counter after      : Not Applicable

This security setting determines the number of minutes that must elapse after a failed logon attempt before the failed logon attempt counter is reset to 0 bad logon attempts. The available range is 1 minute to 99,999 minutes.
If an account lockout threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the Account lockout duration.
Default: None, because this policy setting only has meaning when an Account lockout threshold is specified.

========================================

lockoutduration                          : -18000000000
Account lockout duration                 : Not Applicable

This security setting determines the number of minutes a locked-out account remains locked out before automatically becoming unlocked. The available range is from 0 minutes through 99,999 minutes. If you set the account lockout duration to 0, the account will be locked out until an administrator explicitly unlocks it.
If an account lockout threshold is defined, the account lockout duration must be greater than or equal to the reset time.
Default: None, because this policy setting only has meaning when an Account lockout threshold is specified.

========================================

lockoutthreshold                         : 0
Account lockout threshold                : 0 invalid logon attempts

This security setting determines the number of failed logon attempts that causes a user account to be locked out. A locked-out account cannot be used until it is reset by an administrator or until the lockout duration for the account has expired. You can set a value between 0 and 999 failed logon attempts. If you set the value to 0, the account will never be locked out.
Failed password attempts against workstations or member servers that have been locked using either CTRL+ALT+DELETE or password-protected screen savers count as failed logon attempts.
Default: 0.

========================================

maxpwdage                                : -36288000000000
Maximum password age                     : 42 days

This security setting determines the period of time (in days) that a password can be used before the system requires the user to change it. You can set passwords to expire after a number of days between 1 and 999, or you can specify that passwords never expire by setting the number of days to 0. If the maximum password age is between 1 and 999 days, the Minimum password age must be less than the maximum password age. If the maximum password age is set to 0, the minimum password age can be any value between 0 and 998 days.
Note: It is a security best practice to have passwords expire every 30 to 90 days, depending on your environment. This way, an attacker has a limited amount of time in which to crack a user's password and have access to your network resources.
Default: 42.

========================================

minpwdage                                : -864000000000
Minimum password age                     : 1 days

This security setting determines the period of time (in days) that a password must be used before the user can change it. You can set a value between 1 and 998 days, or you can allow changes immediately by setting the number of days to 0.
The minimum password age must be less than the Maximum password age, unless the maximum password age is set to 0, indicating that passwords will never expire. If the maximum password age is set to 0, the minimum password age can be set to any value between 0 and 998.
Configure the minimum password age to be more than 0 if you want Enforce password history to be effective. Without a minimum password age, users can cycle through passwords repeatedly until they get to an old favorite. The default setting does not follow this recommendation, so that an administrator can specify a password for a user and then require the user to change the administrator-defined password when the user logs on. If the password history is set to 0, the user does not have to choose a new password. For this reason, Enforce password history is set to 1 by default.
Default:
1 on domain controllers.
0 on stand-alone servers.
Note: By default, member computers follow the configuration of their domain controllers.

========================================

minpwdlength                             : 7
Minimum password length                  : 7 characters

This security setting determines the least number of characters that a password for a user account may contain.
The maximum value for this setting is dependent on the value of the Relax minimum password length limits setting.
If the Relax minimum password length limits setting is not defined, this setting may be configured from 0 to 14.
If the Relax minimum password length limits setting is defined and disabled, this setting may be configured from 0 to 14.
If the Relax minimum password length limits setting is defined and enabled, this setting may be configured from 0 to 128.
Setting the required number of characters to 0 means that no password is required.
Note: By default, member computers follow the configuration of their domain controllers.
Default:
7 on domain controllers.
0 on stand-alone servers.
Configuring this setting than 14 may affect compatibility with clients, services, and applications. Microsoft recommends that you only configure this setting larger than 14 after using the Minimum password length audit setting to test for potential incompatibilities at the new setting.

========================================

pwdhistorylength                         : 24
Enforce password history                 : 24 passwords remembers

This security setting determines the number of unique new passwords that have to be associated with a user account before an old password can be reused. The value must be between 0 and 24 passwords.
This policy enables administrators to enhance security by ensuring that old passwords are not reused continually.
Default:
24 on domain controllers.
0 on stand-alone servers.
Note: By default, member computers follow the configuration of their domain controllers.
To maintain the effectiveness of the password history, do not allow passwords to be changed immediately after they were just changed by also enabling the Minimum password age security policy setting. For information about the minimum password age security policy setting, see Minimum password age

========================================

pwdproperties                            : 1
Password must meet complexity requirements

This security setting determines whether passwords must meet complexity requirements.
If this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements:
Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters
Be at least six characters in length
Contain characters from three of the following four categories:
English uppercase characters (A through Z)
English lowercase characters (a through z)
Base 10 digits (0 through 9)
Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %)
Complexity requirements are enforced when passwords are changed or created.
Default:
Enabled on domain controllers.
Disabled on stand-alone servers.
Note: By default, member computers follow the configuration of their domain controllers.
